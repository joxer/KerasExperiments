™s powers to discipline those who dispense unusually high dosages of the same. 
A pharmacist himself, Rannazzisi severely criticized lawmakers he claims hold a double standard â€” publicly vowing to combat the opioid epidemic, while essentially working on behalf of pharmaceutical companies to ensure the industryâ€™s profits. 
â€œThese congressmen and senators who are using this because they are up for re-election, itâ€™s a sham,â€ he told the Guardian . â€œThe congressmen and senators who are championing this fight, the ones who really believe in what theyâ€™re doing, their voices are drowned out because the industry has too much influence.â€ 
With the unique insight of having been an insider, Rannazzisi excoriated the duplicity evidenced between legislatorsâ€™ public lamentation of addiction and deaths from the opioid crisis during election years, and private efforts to protect drugmakers from liability. 
And he would know. According to Rannazzisiâ€™s LinkedIn profile, as Chief of Diversion, he had been tasked with â€œoversight and control of all regulatory compliance inspections and civil and criminal investigations of approximately 1.6 million DEA registrantsâ€â€” but if the standards are lowered by Congress to allow greater leeway in prescribing opioids, the threshold of criminality is raised. 
As the Guardian points out, legislation to fight the opioid epidemic, Comprehensive Addiction and Recovery Act , did, in fact, pass in July â€” but partisan controversy erupted when Republicans failed to provide funding to give the law sharp teeth. Democrats then issued a report titled â€œ Dying Waiting for Treatment â€ in response, which â€œlikened the Republican response to the opioid crisis to â€˜using a piece of chewing gum to patch a cracked dam.â€™â€ 
Indeed the report sharply criticized the bill, equating its policies to â€˜empty promisesâ€™ for the lack of financial follow-through. 
As the Washington Post detailed in a report earlier this month, the DEA launched an aggressive campaign to rein in distribution of opioids by pharmaceutical manufacturers to illegal â€˜pill millsâ€™ and corrupt pharmacies, who cared little whether the drugs wound up on the streets. 
Headed by Rannazzisi, the Office of Diversion Control sent investigators into the field, and began issuing hefty fines and filing lawsuits against the distributors responsible for the proliferation of opioids on the streets. 
But the disproportionately powerful pharmaceutical industry â€” fearing a potential significant loss in profits â€” fought back. Hard. 
According to the Post , the deputy attorney general summoned Rannazzisi to a meeting in 2012, concerning the cases of two unnamed major drug companies. 
â€œThat meeting was to chastise me for going after industry, and thatâ€™s all that meeting was about,â€ the now-retired DEA official told the Post . 
Then, in 2014, came what constituted a hand out to the pharmaceutical industry by the Department of Justice and congressional legislators: the Ensuring Patient Access and Effective Drug Enforcement Act â€” legislation initiated by the Healthcare Distribution Management Association â€” the industry group representing distributors at the heart of the controversy. 
An analysis of lobbying records by the Post found â€œthe Healthcare Distribution Alliance, spent $13 million lobbying House and Senate members and their staffs on the legislation and other issues between 2014 and 2016.â€ 
Rannazzisi argued his case to congressional staffers in a phone conference in July 2014, and recalled telling them, â€œThis bill passes the way itâ€™s written we wonâ€™t be able to get immediate suspension orders, we wonâ€™t be able to stop the hemorrhaging of these drugs out of these bad pharmacies and these bad corporations.â€ 
Stunned at the massive â€” and ultimately successful â€” effort to take the bite out of DEA attempts to hold distributors and drugmakers responsible for their role in an epidemic estimated to take 19,000 lives every year, Rannazzisi likened the legislation to a â€œfree passâ€ for legal drug pushers. 
â€œThis doesnâ€™t ensure patient access and it doesnâ€™t help drug enforcement at all,â€ he told the Guardian. â€œWhat this bill does has nothing to do with the medical process. What this bill does is take away DEAâ€™s ability to go after a pharmacist, a wholesaler, manufacturer or distributor.â€ 
â€œThis was a gift. A gift to the industry,â€ he added. 
After heading the diversion office for a decade, Rannazzisi retired in 2015 â€” likely disgusted over legislatorsâ€™ dedication to the legal drug industry, rather than the people whose interests theyâ€™re ostensibly obligated to protect. 
â€œThe bill passed because â€˜Big Pharmaâ€™ wanted it to pass,â€ he told the Guardian in no uncertain terms. â€œThe DEA is both an enforcement agency and a regulatory agency. When I was in charge what I tried to do was explain to my investigators and my agents that our job was to regulate the industry and theyâ€™re not going to like being regulated.â€ 
Big Pharma relies overwhelmingly on lobbyists filling the coffers of politicians to ensure they ignore the crisis gripping the nation. As the Center for Public Integrity found , the Guardian noted, Purdue Pharma â€” at the heart of the epidemic for its highly-addictive drug introduced in the late 1990s, OxyContin â€” spent a breathtaking $740 million in the last ten years on congressional lobbying efforts. 
However, Big Pharmaâ€™s power to influence policy and legislation extends far beyond simple but effective lobbying â€” the government-run Interagency Pain Research Coordinating Committee (IPRCC) has been accused by Sen. Ron Wyden of being a tool to â€œweakenâ€ CDC guidelines for limiting overprescribing of opioids. 
Wyden wrote to Secretary of Health and Human Services Sylvia Burwell of his concerns the IPRCC had been staffed with â€˜expertsâ€™ with conflicts of interest for their close ties to Big Pharma, including a scientist with a $1.5 million endowment from Purdue, reported the Guardian . 
â€œYouâ€™ve got a panel thatâ€™s certainly got a fair number of people that have a vested interest in this problem of overprescribing. Thatâ€™s something youâ€™ve got to root out,â€ Wyden asserted . â€œThe role of the pharmaceutical companies on these advisory panels troubles me greatly. Science is getting short shrift compared to the political clout of these influential interests.â€ 
Families of countless addicts and victims of the opioid industry would undoubtedly find the direct influence of Big Pharmaâ€™s pro-opioid cash appalling â€” yet it continues to this day. Policies and legislation have not yet been given the appropriate funding needed to effectively combat the problem, which swirls out of control while politicians and drugmakers reap blood-tainted profits. 
â€œCorporations have no conscience,â€ Rannazzisi flatly told the Guardian . â€œUnfortunately, with my job, I was the guy who had to go out and talk to families that lost kids. If one of those CEOs went out there and talked to anybody, or if one of those CEOs happened to lose a kid to this horrible, horrible domestic tragedy we have, Iâ€™d bet you theyâ€™d change their mind. 
â€œWhen you sit with a parent who canâ€™t understand why thereâ€™s so many pharmaceuticals out in the illicit marketplace, and why isnâ€™t the government doing anything, well the DEA was doing something. Unfortunately what weâ€™re trying to do is thwarted by people who are writing laws. Share This Article..."
"Constitutional Law Expert: Comey Did NOT Violate Law By Announcing Email Investigation   Source: Washington's Blog 

Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid alleges that FBI Director Comey has violated the law by announcing the re-opened investigation into Clinton emails so close to the presidential election. 
Is he right? 
One of the top constitutional law experts in the United States (and a liberal), Professor Jonathan Turley, says no : 
[Reidâ€™s] allegation is in my view wildly misplaced. Reid is arguing that the actions of FBI Director James B. Comey violates the Hatch Act . I cannot see a plausible, let alone compelling, basis for such a charge against Comey. 
In his letter to Comey, Reid raised the the Hatch Act, which prohibits partisan politicking by government employees. 
5 U.S.C. Â§ 7323(a)(1) prohibits a government employee from â€œus[ing] his official authority or influence for the purpose of interfering with or affecting the result of an election.â€ 
Reid argued: 
â€œYour actions in recent months have demonstrated a disturbing double standard for the treatment of sensitive information, with what appears to be a clear intent to aid one political party over another. I am writing to inform you that my office has determined that these actions may violate the Hatch Act, which bars FBI officials from using their official authority to influence an election. Through your partisan actions, you may have broken the law.â€ 
The reference to â€œmonthsâ€ is curious. Comey has kept Congress informed in compliance with oversight functions of the congressional committees but has been circumspect in the extent of such disclosures. It is troubling to see Democrats (who historically favor both transparency and checks on executive powers) argue against such disclosure and cooperation with oversight committees. More importantly, the Hatch Act is simply a dog that will not hunt. 
Richard W. Painter, a law professor at the University of Minnesota and the chief ethics lawyer in the George W. Bush White House from 2005 to 2007, has filed a Hatch Act complaint against Comey with the federal Office of Special Counsel and Office of Government Ethics. He argues that â€œWe cannot allow F.B.I. or Justice Department officials to unnecessarily publicize pending investigations concerning candidates of either party while an election is underway.â€ 
However, Comey was between the horns of a dilemma. He could be accused of acts of commission in making the disclosure or omission in withholding the disclosure in an election year. Quite frankly, I found Painterâ€™s justification for his filing remarkably speculative. He admits that he has no evidence to suggest that Comey
