œterrorist.â€ She then allegedly threatened the student, saying â€œIf you tell your mom (about the abuse), watch what happens next.â€ The ACLU said that when the alleged victimâ€™s mom complained to the school, the school director sided with the teacher, stating that she had done nothing wrong. The student was accused of breaking school rules by opening an emergency window while riding on the bus. As a result, both he and his sister â€“ a second grader at the same school â€“ were expelled; effective immediately. The complaints against the teacher wereâ€™t lodged until after the studentsâ€™ expulsion from the school. The Academy of Excellence Charter School is refuting the claims. Theyâ€™ve since released a statement regarding the situation, calling the allegations false. â€œThe Academy of Excellence Charter School Governing Board and Administration (â€œAOEâ€) refutes the allegations contained in two letters from the ACLU. Those letters, both of which are dated October 28, 2016, are devoid of any evidence and contain false and unsubstantiated allegations. AOE conducted an internal investigation on January 25, 2016. That investigation produced no evidence to support the claims now being made . Additionally, these allegations were investigated by the Phoenix Police Department but at that time, her only complaint was that â€œshe believed that her children were kicked out of our school due to their Muslim faith.â€ AOE has many children who practice the Muslim faith. It was not until February 24, 2016, that the mother and her son made the allegation of â€˜choking.â€™ This allegation was investigated by a Detective who found that, â€˜At the conclusion of the investigation, a crime in this matter was unfounded. Both suspect and witnesses provided corroborating statements, and were not consistent with the victimsâ€™ statement.â€™ This is the â€œcursory and inadequateâ€ investigation the ACLU notes in the footnotes to its letters. Finally, if you compare the timing of events contained in the ACLUâ€™s letters and the statements made to the Police by the teacher and the student, they are completely different. The difference between the statements calls into question the motive of the plaintif. AOEâ€™s first contact from the ACLU sought a substantial monetary payment.â€ (DING DING DING!

Sounds great, but the cynic in me tells me that Iâ€™ve heard similar for the the last 3 or 4 years, that this or that is gonna happen to Obama or Clinton etc etc & of course nothing ever did. Seeing is believing. That being said, this time with the release of the latest batch of Criminal Clintonâ€™s, Weiner & Abedin emails, I think this time thereâ€™s enough to make the mud stick. Especially now that the Intelligence Community & sections of the FBI are really pissed off. I wonâ€™t be holding my breath, but as Sir Winston Churchill once said â€œA week is a long time in politicsâ€. Dajjal November 2, 2016 @ 4:33 am 
Moe, there are many pissed off people in the CIA, FBI & Pentagon plus a plethora who were purged, who have scores to settle with Obamination and some of them have the means. Ä‘ÂŸÂ™Â‚ We may never know who really tipped off Wikileaks, it may be an inside job. 
Rumor has it the email archive folder on Weinerâ€™s laptop was named â€œlife insuranceâ€. Did Weiner archive those emails for their blackmail value? Did he contemplate triggering a dead man switch? Too many questions, not enough answers. Don Spilman November 2, 2016 @ 2:29 am 
There is going to be some major shakeup. Thank you BNI I sent this immediately to my base. These are very vile evil people we are dealing with and they will react like a cornered mountain lion. The next few days are going to be interesting."
"SHOCKER!!! Left Wing MSNBC commentator Chris Mathews has just endorsed Donald Trump for president In the meantime, Hillary Clinton has just ordered a fireworks display to celebrate her winning the election on Nov. 8th. But this could blow up in her face! Hillary Clinton may have lit the fuse for her victory celebration a little too soon â€” by planning an Election Night explosion of fireworks over the Hudson River in New York City. NY Post NYC Cops and firefighters were blown away by Clintonâ€™s hubris in planning the fireworks display, which would eclipse the shower of blazing sparkles that preceded the balloon drop at Julyâ€™s Democratic National Convention. Somebody asked â€œIf she loses, will she take the displsy over to the East Side and sell it to Trump for half-price?â€"

"MASSACHUSETTS: Designated Terrorist Group CAIR demands synagogue cancel speakers who are pro-Israel anti-Islam The speakers include leading counter-jihadists Frank Gaffney of Investigative Project on Terrorism, General Jerry Boykin, and Tom Trento of The United West, all of whom are warriors in the battle to stop the Islamization of America. Somebody needs to tell the CAIR jihadists to mind their own damn business, the truth about CAIR and the death cult posing as a religion is getting out, despite their best efforts to whitewash it."
"BNI Store Nov 2 2016 â€œWEâ€™VE HAD ENOUGH!â€ Italian Prime Minister threatens to cripple the EU unless it stops mass Muslim migration FURIOUS Italian leader Matteo Renzi today threatened to fatally cripple the entire European Union project unless Brussels bureaucrats do something about ending the Muslim invasion. UK Express In an extraordinary threat the apoplectic PM vowed to veto the EU budget and starve Brussels of taxpayersâ€™ cash, inducing complete paralysis, if the refugee chaos is not fixed by the end of this year. A visibly angry Mr Renzi warned that Italy â€œcannot surviveâ€ another influx of migrants in 2017 similar to the one it faced this year and blasted Europeâ€™s â€œinability to show solidarityâ€ on the issue. His remarkable threat marks another ratcheting up of the growing tensions between Rome and Brussels, whose friendship has been stretched to breaking point by the migration crisis. Italy has become the focal point for millions of migrants and refugees hoping to reach Europe ever since the route to Greece was effectively cut off by a repatriation deal with Turkey. More than 155,000 Muslim freeloaders posing as asylum seekers have arrived in the country this year alone after crossing the Mediterranean from Libya on rickety smugglersâ€™ boats. But Austria, Switzerland and France to the north have shored up their borders meaning almost all of those have become trapped in Italy, placing a huge strain on services and local communities. Speaking to the talk show Porta a Porta last night, Mr Renzi blasted: â€œEither we block the influx by 2017 or Italy will not handle another year like the past year.â€ And he warned: â€œRight now we can manage it. Winter is coming and sea conditions will worsen, but we have six months maximum.â€ Mr Renzi also strongly hinted that he will veto the EU budget in retaliation for the critical situation unless Brussels steps in and forces member states to take in their fair share of migrants. He blasted: â€œIf the Eastern countries who are growing with the help of our money do not open their doors to migrants as has been agreed, then weâ€™ll put a veto on the future European budget.â€ An EU Commission to impose migrant quotas on countries has run into difficulty following furious opposition from eastern European countries and a less than enthusiastic response from others already struggling with the pressures of mass migration. A number of member states including Hungary, which recently held a referendum where 98 per cent of voters rejected migrant quotas, are even taking legal proceedings against the EU in a bid to hold up the scheme. And Italyâ€™s interior minister, Angelino Alfano, backed up Mr Renziâ€™s extraordinary ultimatum to veto the EU budget and withhold funds from Brussels unless it resolves the impasse. He said: â€œWe must use the veto. We give our money so that, in exchange for these duties, the others honour their commitments. â€œMoney does not go through walls. You know what? If they donâ€™t help us, we will not give more money.â€ Referring to the countryâ€™s net budget contribution under its former leader, the technocrat Mario Monti, he added: â€œThe Monti government determined that we give 20 billion [euros] and receive 12, but if Hungary and Slovakia give us moral lessons about our money and then refuse to give us a hand on migrants, that doesnâ€™t work.â€"
"BNI Store Nov 2 2016 BREAKING BOMBSHELL: NYPD blows whistle on new Hillary emails: Money Laundering, Pay to Play, Perjury, Sex Crimes with Children, Child Exploitation New York Police Department (NYPD) detectives and prosecutors working an alleged underage sexting case against former Congressman Anthony Weiner have turned over a newly-found laptop he shared with wife Huma Abedin to the FBI with enough evidence â€œto put Hillary (Clinton) and her crew away for life,â€ NYPD sources said. TruePundit NYPD sources said Clintonâ€™s â€œcrewâ€ also included several unnamed yet implicated members of Congress in addition to her aides and insiders. The NYPD seized the computer from Weiner during a search warrant and detectives discovered a trove of over 500,000 emails to and from Hillary Clinton, Abedin and other insiders during her tenure as secretary of state. The content of those emails sparked the FBI to reopen its defunct email investigation into Clinton on Friday. But new revelations on the contents of that laptop, according to law enforcement sources, implicate the Democratic presidential candidate, her subordinates, and even select elected officials in far more alleged ser
