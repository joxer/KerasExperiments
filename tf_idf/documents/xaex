ly hope) Led by Republican Governor Sam Brownback the state of Kansas informed the Obama administration this week that it is defying its dictates for Kansas to cooperate in the resettlement of refugees from Syria. In a letter to Robert Carey, director of the Office of Refugee Resettlement, Brownback wrote, “The State of Kansas hereby withdraws its Refugee Resettlement Program State Plan and terminates its participation in all federal refugee resettlement grants and programs, effective at the earliest possible date.” Hopefully, they are the last Brownback added that he was taking his action to “protect the safety and security interests of the State of Kansas.”"

"GREECE: Illegal alien Muslim invaders set fire to their camp on island of Lesbos Apparently, the Islamic freeloaders, mainly from Pakistan and Bangladesh (neither of which is a war-torn country), are upset over delays in processing their asylum claims, so they set fire to facilities used by the European Asylum Support Office (EASO). EuroNews A bout 70 Muslim illegals threw rocks and burning blankets at containers inside the Moria camp, damaging a number of them. A spokesman for EASO said protesters had hurled petrol bombs while interviews with Muslim asylum-seekers were taking place. Riots have broken out before among Muslim asylum seekers with more than 15,000 living in overcrowded camps on Greek islands close to Turkey. (Send the Muslim parasites back where they came from. Then close the camp)"
"BNI Store Oct 31 2016 UK MUSLIMS want to subject non-Muslims to the noise pollution of the amplified ‘Islamic Call to Prayer’ several times a day If Muslim supremacists get their way, British residents and visitors will be forced to endure the eardrum-shattering, highly offensive Islamic Call to Prayer (‘Adhan’) being blasted from mosque amplifiers – so it can be heard for miles around – at least three times a day, EVERYDAY! UK Express (h/t Rob E) A petition to allow the Islamic call for prayer has been signed by more than 25,000 Muslims. Those behind the petition say: “The Islamic Call to Prayer, is an integral part of the Muslim faith ” which actually means unbelievers are my inferiors and I have no respect for their country, customs, and its citizens. The petition says: “I believe it is the right time to experiment and allow highly Muslim populated areas with a loud call for prayer at least three times a day, not during anti-social hours.” “The number of people practicing the religion of Islam in the United Kingdom exceeds three million. “Some neighbourhood towns have more than 50% Muslim population.” The Government’s official response to the petition has advised people to speak to their local authority about public calls to worship. Officials said: “The Government recognizes the unique contribution (to violence, rape, and terrorism) that Muslims make to their own local communities and to wider society.”"
"BNI Store Oct 31 2016 WELCOME TO PARIS where tour buses have to navigate around all the new Muslim tent cities filling the streets Now that France has shut down the filthy Calais ‘jungle’ camp where thousands of illegal alien Muslim invaders had been squatting, Muslim tent cities are sprouting up all over the streets of Paris. Gee, I guess French tourism hasn’t taken a big enough hit yet, following several Islamic terrorist attacks.Â"
"PENNSYLVANIA GUN STORE tells customers “Muslims and Hillary supporters are not welcome” An advertisement for ALTRA FIREARMS warns potential customers that Muslims and supporters of Hillary Clinton, who are “terrorists” in the store’s parlance, are not welcome. âPlease NO Muslims or Hillary Supporters â We do not feel safe selling to terrorists!â Altra Firearms in Jackson Center, Pennsylvania advertised in local papers this week.Â TalkingPointsMemo Â The âPolitically Incorrect Firearmsâ store also invited readers to âVisit our underground bunker and speak with our unique and deplorable sales associates.â Altra Firearms’ owner Paul Chandler, 54, told TPM Friday that heâs had a sign in front of his store advertising that supporters of President Obama arenât welcome to come inside, either. âWe did have, in three-foot letters, âNo radical Muslims,â but I changed that to âNo Muslims,â period,â Chandler said in a phone interview, noting rhetoric from Iranian television motivated the change. âTheyâre saying that America is the great Satan and itâs got to be destroyed. Theyâre basically teaching that if itâs an infidel, either they convert or kill them. And thatâs what theyâre doing in our country now,â he said, comparing the actions of modern Islamic nations to the expansion of Muslim influence into Europe before the Crusades.Â âIf the gun store in Florida wouldnât have sold to that man, thereâs be 40 or 50 more people alive,â he continued, referring to Omar Mateen, who killed 49 people in Orlando when he opened fire in an LGBT nightclub.Â PA gun store ad: ""please no Muslims or Hillary supporters.

— Dorey Scheimer (@DoreyScheimer) October 27, 2016 Chandler told TPM he’s never actually denied service to any Muslims or Clinton supporters, although he said he’d told one woman with an Obama bumper sticker on her car that the store was closed. He also said he’d denied service to one man who told him âI hate niggers, I want a gun.âÂ Chandler said he didnât extend the same blanket ban to potential Christian customers after a series of abortion clinic bombings years ago because âhundreds of Christian preachers got up and said âthat is wrong.â” âDo you hear any Muslim clerics condemning what is going on today?â he asked. âI havenât heard one.â In 2015, designated terrorist group CAIR (Council on American-Islamic Relations) sued a different store in Florida ( FLORIDA GUN SUPPLY ) which declared itself a ‘Muslim Free Zone’ but the case was dismissed."
"BNI Store Oct 31 2016 Do Canadian taxpayers know they are funding welfare for polygamous Muslim migrant families with up to 4 wives and countless children? Canadian Liberals have been stonewalling on any access to information requests relating to the Syrian Muslim migrants they’ve been shipping in by the tens of thousands . They’re either embarrassed by the facts or don’t even want to know what the facts actually are. Back in 2008, Toronto media left and right reported on hundreds of polygamous Muslim families in Toronto, many on welfare. Has anything changed? Neither Canada’s government nor its welfare agencies bother to screen for polygamous marriages. And the media won’t breathe a word about it."
"NETHERLANDS has a new Muslim political party called ‘DENK’ (Think) created by Muslim colonizers for Muslim colonizers Founded by 2 Turkish Muslims, Tunahan Kuzu and Selçuk Öztürk, after being booted out of the Dutch Labour Party, the Denk Partij (Think Party) is the first political force in Europe established by Muslims and is attracting controversy for its affiliation with the Turkish Islamist regime, rejection of the Armenian Genocide, and radical anti-Israel positions. DENK is also proposing a 1,000 strong ‘racism’ police and national anti-immigration registry which will target anyone who says anything ‘Islamophobic’ against Muslims. Legal Insurrection is reporting ( h/t Truth Revolt ) that the Netherlands’ pro-Muslim immigration Denk Party is pushing for a thousand-strong “Racism Police” to go after thought and speech crimes against Muslims which would result in a registry for offenders, fines, and re-education camps. The party, dominated by members of Turkish and Muslim origin was founded in 2014 by two former-socialist Turkish politicians but it already sits in the Dutch parliament and is hoping to mobilize the country’s million-strong mainly Muslim immigrant population (out of about 17 million overall) and growing Muslim population, currently at about 7 percent, in the parliamentary elections to be held early next year. Tunahan Kuzu and Selçuk Öztürk Among the Denk Party’s latest proposals are the renaming of streets and tunnels suggestive of Dutch colonial and slave trading history, changing the term “foreigner” to “Turkish and Surinamese Dutch person,” creating a thousand-man “Racism Police,” establishing stricter sentences for “racist and discriminatory behavior,” and listing offenders on a nationwide “Racism Register” — you know, just like child molesters. This multicultural champion has close ties to Erdogan’s Turkish-Islamist AKP party and it refuses to recognize the genocide of Armenian Christians. According to a recent Dutch poll, nearly 90 percent of young Turkish-Dutch sympathize with ISIS — 90 percent . This is the Denk Party’s political base. Denk Party stands in the tradition of George Galloway’s Respect Party in UK, a new mutant ideology taking root in Europe that fuses leftist “social justice” issues with political Islam, dipped in fierce hatred for Israel and Western heritage. Last month, the Denk Party attracted media attention when party’s leader and Dutch MP Tunahan Kuzu refused to shake hands with the visiting Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netenyahu. What should worry the freedom-loving people — on the either side of the Atlantic — is not just the outrageous nature of Denk Party’s proposals, but the determined effort already underway in Europe to criminalize “undesired” speech and political dissident. The E.U. has long been pressuring its media to omit mentions of Islam when Muslims ar
